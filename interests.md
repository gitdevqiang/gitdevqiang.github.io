## Research Interests

### Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

Developing machine learning and deep learning models for clinical decision support, disease prediction (e.g., liver fibrosis, cancer), and patient outcome modeling using EHR data.

### Graph Machine Learning

Designing graph neural networks (GNNs), especially for biomedical applications like protein interactions, patient graphs, and knowledge graphs.

### Bioinformatics & Computational Biology

Modeling biological sequences (e.g., proteins, genes) using transformer-based models for tasks like protein-protein interaction and host-pathogen modeling.

### Multimodal and Cross-Domain Learning

Integrating heterogeneous data types (e.g., text, lab values, medical images, molecular sequences) and transferring knowledge across domains with limited supervision.

### Natural Language Processing

Extracting clinical insights from free-text medical notes using large language models (LLMs) and rule-based systems.
