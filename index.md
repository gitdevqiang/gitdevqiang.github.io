# About Me

<img src="https://qiangyangcs.github.io/Qiang_r.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

I am Qiang Yang, a Ph.D. candidate in King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). I major in computer science in the labs of [Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering (MINE)](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/) and [Structural and Functional Bioinformatics Group (SFB)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/sfb). I am supervised by Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/) and Prof. [Xin Gao](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/xin-gao). My dissertation focuses on interpretable learning on heterogeneous graphs, which reveals the predicted results by heterogeneous graph models. This renders the predictions understandable, tranprant, and compelling.

My current research focuses on interpretable graph learning on heterogeneous graph relavent tasks, such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. Interpretable learning on heterogeneous graphs involves applying machine learning techniques to complex graphs containing diverse node and edge types, with a focus on explaining model predictions. This entails feature extraction from heterogeneous data, the use of interpretable models like decision trees or rule-based systems, and the incorporation of explainability methods such as feature importance scores and attention mechanisms. Understanding cross-type relationships and ensuring scalability are key challenges, while applications span recommendation systems, fraud detection, biology, and knowledge graph reasoning. Ethical considerations, such as bias detection and fairness, are integral to responsible heterogeneous graph interpretation, making it essential for transparent and accountable decision-making in diverse real-world contexts.

Also, my PhD research explores the dynamic field of multimodal mining. Multimodal mining encompasses the analysis and machine learning applied to heterogeneous data sources, which can include text, images, audio, and more. Its primary objective is to extract valuable insights by seamlessly integrating and analyzing these diverse modalities, employing techniques such as feature fusion and the investigation of intermodal relationships. Its versatile applications extend to computer vision, natural language processing, healthcare, and autonomous systems, though it presents challenges such as data alignment, dimensionality reduction, and ethical considerations. Particularly, I focus on image captioning task which aims to generate the natural language for the image. Differenet from existing tasks, we try to generate caption for context-aware multiple images.

I obtained Master degree with outstanding Master student award from Soochow University advised by Prof. Zhixu Li. During this processing, I mainly focus on database systems. Particularly, the overall goal is to improve data quality where I did some researches like record matching and data cleaning. Also, the exploration on the knowledge graphs (KGs) was done, like KG construction, representation, and so on.
