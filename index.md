# About Me

<img src="https://qiangyangcs.github.io/Qiang_r.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

I'm Qiang Yang, a PhD candidate in King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). I major in computer science in the labs of [Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering (MINE)](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/) and [Structural and Functional Bioinformatics Group(SFB)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/sfb). I am supervised by Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/) and Prof. [Xin Gao](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/xin-gao). My dissertation focuses on interpretable learning on heterogeneous graphs, which reveals the predicted results by heterogeneous graph models. This renders the predictions understandable, tranprant, and compelling.

- Data Mining
- Graph Representation Learning
- Interpretable Leaning
- Multimodal Learning
- Sentiment Analysis
- Sound Analysis

My current research focuses on interpretable graph learning to interpret how the prediction made by graph models is generated on the graph relavent tasks, such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. Multimodal mining is also explored in my PhD period. During my master studying, I have the background of Knowledge graph (KG) mining such as KG construction, KG representations, and so on.  The database systems relevant tasks are also done including data cleaning, and data matching.
