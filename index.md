# About Me

<img src="https://gitdevqiang.github.io/Qiang_rr.jpg" class="floatpic" width="450" height="560">

I am Qiang (John) Yang, a Postdoctoral Associate at the Department of Health Outcomes & Biomedical Informatics, University of Florida, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Rui Yin](https://rayin-saber.github.io/yinrui.github.io/). My research lies at the intersection of graph neural networks (GNNs), interpretable machine learning, and their applications on heterogeneous graphs in biomedical informatics. I am also deeply engaged in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address complex challenges in biomedical science and healthcare.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in 2023, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/) and Prof. [Xin Gao](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/xin-gao) at the lab of [Machine Intelligence and kNowledge Engineering (MINE)](https://sites.nd.edu/xiangliang-zhang/) and [Structural and Functional Bioinformatics Group (SFB)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/sfb). My dissertation focused on interpretable learning for heterogeneous graphs, aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of GNN models through the generation of interpretable graph structures.

Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my Master’s degree from Soochow University, where I was honored with the Outstanding Master Student Award. Under the guidance of Prof. [Zhixu Li](https://sites.google.com/site/zhixuli), I worked on database systems, with a focus on data quality improvement through techniques such as record matching and data cleaning. I also explored knowledge graphs (KGs), contributing to areas such as KG construction and representation learning.
